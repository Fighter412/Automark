# Automark
This is a software I developed for my A-Level computer science coursework to automatically mark student exam papers.
It makes use of AWS technology:
AWS Lambda - Cloud processing
AWS S3 - Storage
AWS DynamoDB - Database
AWS Textract - OCR software
AWS Bedrock - AI models (Mistral AI Large (24.04))
